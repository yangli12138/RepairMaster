To address the vulnerability in the code, we need to add a check to ensure that the `index` is not only less than the length of the array but also greater than or equal to 0. This will prevent negative indices which could lead to accessing out-of-bounds memory. Here's the repaired code:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int getValueFromArray(int *array, int len, int index) {
    int value;

    // Check that the array index is within bounds
    if (index >= 0 && index < len) {
        // Get the value at the specified index of the array
        value = array[index];
    } 
    // If array index is invalid, then output error message
    // and return value indicating error
    else {
        printf("Error: Invalid index %d. Index should be between 0 and %d.\n", index, len - 1);
        value = -1;
    }

    return value;
}
```

In this modified version, the code checks if `index` is both greater than or equal to 0 and less than `len`, which ensures the access is within the proper bounds. If the index is out of bounds, it prints an error message and returns `-1` to indicate an error.
