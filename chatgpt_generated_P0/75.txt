To address the integer underflow vulnerability in the given code, you should add a check before the subtraction operation to ensure that it doesn't lead to underflow. Here's the repaired code:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdbool.h>

int main(void) {
    int i;
    i = -2147483648;

    // Check to prevent integer underflow
    if (i > -2147483648) {
        i = i - 1;
    } else {
        printf("Integer underflow prevented: i is already at the minimum value.\n");
    }

    return 0;
}
```

In this fixed version of the code, before performing the subtraction, we check if `i` is greater than the minimum value a 32-bit signed integer can hold. If it's not, we avoid performing the subtraction and print a warning message instead. This prevents integer underflow and ensures the program executes safely.
