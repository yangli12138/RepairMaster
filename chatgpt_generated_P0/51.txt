To address the vulnerability in the given code snippet, we need to avoid using format strings that can be externally controlled. However, in the provided example, the format string is directly controlled and defined within the code and not by external input, so it technically doesn't exhibit CWE-134, which involves actual external control (like format strings coming from user input). 

Nonetheless, we can emphasize safe and clear code by following best practices in formatting. Here’s the improved version of the given code, ensuring clarity and safety:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int value1 = 5;
    int value2 = 9;
    // Use a fixed and safe format specifier without redundancy
    printf("%d %d %d %d\n", value1, value2, value1, value1);
    return 0;
}
```

In this improved version, the format string is still specified internally. It avoids unnecessary uses of format specifiers, focusing on clarity and simplicity. Importantly, to handle actual CWE-134 vulnerabilities in real-world scenarios, it is crucial to avoid incorporating any user-controlled input directly into format specifiers without validation and sanitization.
