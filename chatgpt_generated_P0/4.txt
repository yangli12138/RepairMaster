Here is the repaired code with additional checks to ensure that the index is within both the minimum and maximum bounds of the array:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int getValueFromArray(int *array, int len, int index) {
    int value;

    // Check that the array index is within valid bounds
    if (index >= 0 && index < len) {
        // Get the value at the specified index of the array
        value = array[index];
    } else {
        // If array index is invalid, output error message
        // and return value indicating error
        printf("Error: Array index is out of bounds.\n");
        value = -1;
    }

    return value;
}
```

In this revised code, we added a check to ensure that `index` is not only less than `len`, but also greater than or equal to `0`. This prevents the possibility of a negative index, which could lead to an out-of-bounds read.
