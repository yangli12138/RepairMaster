To address the vulnerability in the provided C code, we need to ensure that the `str` array is properly initialized before using it with `strcat`. This can be done by initializing the array with a null terminator at the beginning. This change will prevent reading uninitialized memory and will ensure that the `strcat` function works correctly by starting the concatenation at the right position.

Here's the repaired code:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

int main() {
    char str[20] = "";  // Properly initialize the array with a null terminator

    strcat(str, "hello world");
    printf("%s\n", str);

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:
- The array `str` is initialized with an empty string (`""`), which effectively places a null terminator at the start of `str`, ensuring that `strcat` begins concatenation at the correct location.
- The size of the `str` array is sufficient to hold the concatenated result `"hello world"`.
