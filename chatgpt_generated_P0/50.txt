To resolve the vulnerability of CWE-134: Use of Externally-Controlled Format String, the code should be updated such that it does not directly use the input as a format string. Instead, a fixed format string should be applied. Here's the revised code:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
    char buf[128];

    if (argc > 1) {
        // Use a fixed format string to safely copy the input to the buffer
        snprintf(buf, sizeof(buf), "%s", argv[1]);
    } else {
        fprintf(stderr, "Usage: %s <input string>\n", argv[0]);
        return 1;
    }

    // For demonstration purposes, printing the buffer
    printf("Buffer content: %s\n", buf);

    return 0;
}
```

### Key Changes Made:
- Added a check to ensure that the program has at least one command line argument before proceeding.
- Used a static format string `"%s"` with `snprintf()` to safely copy the input to the buffer, preventing malicious format string injection.
- Provided a user-friendly error message if the command line argument is missing.

These changes address the vulnerability by ensuring that external input is not interpreted as a format string.
