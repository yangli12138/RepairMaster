To address the vulnerability of uncontrolled recursion in the provided C code, we need to ensure that the condition `flg` is eventually set or modified such that it breaks the recursive calls. Here's the repaired code:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

// Function to perform some recursive work
void do_something_recursive(int flg) {
    // Simulate doing some work - this could be any operation
    printf("Doing some work, flg: %d\n", flg);

    // Modify the value of flg to eventually break out of the recursion
    flg--;

    // Check the exit condition before making the recursive call
    if (flg > 0) {
        do_something_recursive(flg); // Recursive call
    }
}

int main() {
    int flag = 5; // Set to a positive number to allow some iterations
    do_something_recursive(flag); // Start the recursive process
    return 0;
}
```

### Key Changes:

1. **Modification of `flg`:** In each recursive call, we decrement `flg`. This ensures that eventually `flg` becomes zero, breaking the recursion loop and preventing stack overflow.

2. **Exit Condition:** The condition `if (flg > 0)` ensures that the recursion only continues if `flg` is still positive.

By implementing these changes, the recursion is now controlled, preventing infinite recursive calls and potential stack exhaustion.
